# Dovetails

This is a simple little project to generate dovetail layout templates
for the Shaper Origin CNC.  You can run it locally with `yarn start`
or compile a static build with `yarn build` after installing
dependencies with `yarn install`.  There is no backend for this
project, it just generates the template SVG files directly on the
frontend.

## Saved Configurations

You can now save and load your dovetail configurations in the UI. Use the
banner at the top of the application to name a configuration, save it to your
browser, and reload any saved configuration later.

You can find the current production version of this live at
[https://dovetails.bieber.dev](https://dovetails.bieber.dev).
